# Step 2: Creating a virtual machine for Windows Server and Clients PC;

## Download and install Windows Server image file (.ISO) 

For the test it can be downloaded from Microsoft.
I choose ver. 2016:

Here I will not explain in detail what are the steps when creating a new virtual machine in VirtualBox, but it is important to set parameters that meet the minimum requirements of the respective operating system.

I set:

- Disk space - 80 GB
- Base memory - 4 GB (4096 MB)

After creating the virtual machine in Settings -> Storage -> Optical drive load your Windows Server .ISO file

Then start the machine and install the server.


## Download and install Windows 10 && 11 image file (.ISO)
